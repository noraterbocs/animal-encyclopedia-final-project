      text: 'Hey there! I am a frontend developer aspiring to become a fullstack developer. I started learning coding by taking free online courses and making small projects during my free time. I gained hands-on experience in creating and maintaining Javascript applications while working in a product team in customer service operations. Besides that, I have also managed IT projects within data migration and process design. Later on, I joined a web development bootcamp to round up my knowledge. As a project manager and frontend developer, I am great at tackling problems and simplifying complex tasks. Furthermore, I have demonstrated a consistent ability to manage my time efficiently while maintaining clear and effective communication with stakeholders across diverse functions and departments.',
